# Parallax Website

This is a simple one-page website with a parallax effect, showcasing the usage of HTML, and CSS to create a visually appealing scrolling experience. The website consists of multiple sections with background images and content. The background images create a parallax effect, which gives an illusion of depth as the user scrolls down the page.

## Demo
